%In this directory, you will find a derivaitve function representing a
%three gene circuit in which each gene product represses the transcription of another
%gene in a cycle. This simple three gene circuit displays oscillations and was one
%of the first synthetic circuits ever constructed (see Elowitz & Leibler
%Nature 2000). 

% 1. Start with initial conditions x(1) = 1, x(2) = x(3) = 0. 
% Run the model for 200 time units and plot the result. verify that it
% does indeed oscillate. 

sol = ode23(@repressilator,[0 200],[1,0,0]);
plot(sol.y(1,:),sol.y(2,:));
hold on;

% 2. What happens if you start with initial conditions x(1) = x(2) = x(3) =
% 0.5? Why?

sol = ode23(@repressilator,[0 200],[0.5,0.5,0.5]);
plot(sol.y(1,:),sol.y(2,:));
hold on;

% if the same value is used for x1, x2 and x3, all three of the equations
% within the repressilator function are identical. Because of this, all
% genes affect each other equally, so any change would be equal for all
% three, resulting in a linear change rather than an oscillation. 

% 3. The strength of the repression is governed by the constant k2 which is
% the same for all the genes. What happens when you make k2 larger or
% smaller? Find the approximate value of k2 for which the system no longer
% oscillates. 

% only at a k2 value of 0 would there be no dependence between the two
% genes. Even a small value of k2 would introduce interdependency between
% the two genes, resulting in oscillation. 

% 4. What happens when you make k2 larger or smaller for only one of the
% genes? 

% when k2 is increased for one gene, that gene controls the entire network.
% if the value of k2 is decreased for one gene,
